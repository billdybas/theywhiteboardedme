## What is they.whiteboarded.me?

_they.whiteboarded.me_ aims to be a crowd-sourced and curated list of companies
that engage in good and bad interview practices. This allows job-seekers to
only engage with companies whose interview processes are a good fit for them.

## What is the mission of they.whiteboarded.me?

To promote diversity and inclusivity for all tech practitioners, regardless of
experience level, educational background, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, etc.

It is no secret that the tech sector is growing at an unprecedented rate,
accelerating every day. With this growth, companies cannot hire candidates fast
enough. In fact, a common refrain amongst tech recruiters and tech hiring
managers is that they simply cannot grow their teams as fast as they would
like.

However, many companies will not stop these practices until they have a good
reason for doing so. We, as tech workers, must provide that reason. If we slow
growth by refusing to submit to demoralizing interviews, we have the capability
to change our industry.

## What does “whiteboarding” mean?

The term whiteboarding refers to the practice of asking a job interview
candidate to implement an algorithm on a dry-erase marker board (commonly
called a whiteboard) using their programming language of choice.

This term has grown to include metaphorical practices such as asking a candidate to code up
an algorithm in real-time using a computer while the interviewer looks over
their shoulder. The only difference between this practice and whiteboarding is that the
candidate can remain seated with a keyboard. They are still expected to write
a working program in real-time.

For more information, [this
article](/interview_types/whiteboarding_and_live_coding.html) discusses the
practice in greater detail.

## What types of technical interviews are there?

There are three major types of applicant evaluations, which will be discussed
separately:

1. [Whiteboarding and Live Coding](/interview_types/whiteboarding_and_live_coding.html)
2. [Online Coding Challenges](/interview_types/online_coding_challenges.html)
3. [Homework Assignments](/interview_types/homework.html)

While each of these has its advantages and disadvantages, most of the
ire is directed at whiteboarding, live-coding, and online coding challenges.

## Are you suggesting that candidates should not have to demonstrate competency?

No. We ([and others](/additional-resources.html)) are suggesting is that
the current methods of demonstrating competency do not actually measure
competency, nor do they effectively predict a software engineer’s performance.

## Why should I believe this random website?

Here is a [curated list](/additional-resources.html) of relevant links, sources,
and additional resources for your further consideration.

## How is this different than Glassdoor?

While [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com) allows you to submit a review of
a company's interview process, it is not particularly tech-focused. Additionally,
finding which companies do whiteboarding and live-coding vs. those who do not
is very difficult on Glassdoor.

## How do I submit changes?

- Send a [pull request]({{ site.github_repo_link }}) via GitHub
- Submit a [GitHub issue]({{ site.github_repo_link }}/issues)
- Tweet [@{{ site.twitter_username }}](http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username }})
- Contact our friends at [Hiring Without Whiteboards](http://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards)

## Can I submit anonymous feedback?

Due to some concerns about the validity of the data and feedback received, we've
made the difficult decision to discontinue receiving anonymous submissions.
Some of the submissions received lacked important information and context about
a some company's interview process and the anonymity made it impossible
to follow up to gain additional context.

Going forward, we will only accept changes via the channels listed above.

## What can I do to help?

- Please help keep this site up-to-date
- Refuse to interview at companies that use these stressful interview processes
  and be sure to state your reasons for declining the interview
- If your company whiteboards, please work to fix your interview process since
  it will only hurt your company in the long run
